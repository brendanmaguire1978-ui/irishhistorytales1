	<p>I really enjoyed researching and developing the content for the latest edition
"The Pretty Dragoon", which was a nickname given to the Irish woman - Kit Cavanagh, an 
extraordinary woman who joined the British army and served undiscovered in the army for 
13 years.</p>
<p> She had been a tavern owner in Dublin and after her beloved husband was 'pressed' into
the British Army, she volunteered to join the army to find him. During her search, she even
duelled and killed a fellow soldier in a dispute over a woman, and a prostitute even accused
her of being the 'father' of one of her children. </p>
