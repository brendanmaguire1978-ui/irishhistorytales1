      "content": "<p>Welcome to the new home of Irish History Tales. I’ve built this dedicated space to bring together my chronological history series and the world of my novel, <em>Verses in the Sand</em>.</p><p>Recently, it’s become clear that the TikTok algorithm is making it harder for long-form educational content to reach its audience. Because of this, I am shifting to a <strong>YouTube-first focus</strong>. While I will still share the story of Ireland on TikTok, YouTube will now be the primary home for my deeper dives into the forgotten figures and unsung heroes of our past.</p><p>I would be incredibly grateful for your support—whether through a like, a comment, or by exploring my book series. On that note, I’m thrilled to announce that Book 2 is nearing completion and will be released very soon!</p>"

During her search, she even duelled and killed a fellow soldier in a dispute over a woman, and a prostitute even accused her of being the 'father' of one of her children. </p><p> For more information, watch the full video on YouTube below </p><div class='video-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xr0I8zZt5fM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>"
