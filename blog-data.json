Book 2 will be released very soon.</p>"

      "content": "<p>I really enjoyed researching and developing the content for the latest edition 'The Pretty Dragoon', which was a nickname given to the Irish woman - Kit Cavanagh, an extraordinary woman who joined the British army and served undiscovered in the army for 13 years.</p><p> She had been a tavern owner in Dublin and after her beloved husband was 'pressed' into the British Army, she volunteered to join the army to find him. During her search, she even duelled and killed a fellow soldier in a dispute over a woman, and a prostitute even accused her of being the 'father' of one of her children. </p><p> For more information, watch the full video on YouTube below </p><div class='video-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xr0I8zZt5fM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>"
